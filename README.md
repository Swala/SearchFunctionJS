# SearchFunctionJS

Used express, javascript, HTML and CSS

I did a live search where the input String should match with all values for each property in the object. 

Set GET and POST in index.js with express and use fetch from main.js to retrieve response.

The null values had to be removed/filtered out. Tried with filter and for-loop (see the commented-out function in searchHandler.js) but could not get it to work.
Alternative was a .fromEntries() that seemed to work.

Started on a card-component but ran out of time, so the application only displays a simple list.
